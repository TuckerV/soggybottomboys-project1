            I am Sean King, and I was primarily assigned to making this project look good with coding our CSS, including selecting our framework, Bulma, and making sure that the HTML worked effectively within that framework. I was born and raised in Provo, Utah, and achieved a degree from the University of Utah in Health, Society, and Policy. I started in coding because I'm always looking for something interesting and challenging, and wanted to push myself to a new level in a new career.

              My name is Tucker Vassau, and I was in charge of the javascript portion of the project. My responsibilities included making sure the API calls were functioning as intended, and creating the code that would enable the various functions of the website to work. A little bit about myself, I was born and raised in a place called Mercer Island in Washington. I grew up playing lots of sports, and enjoying my time being outside. I came to Utah, and attended BYU where I received my bachelors degree in economics. Quickly after graduation, I realized that I wanted to work doing something with computers where I would be able to create, and use my creativity, hence how I ended up in this class! I took this class because I was interested in becoming a web developer, and wanted to gain the practical skills necessary to enter the field I wanted to be in.
